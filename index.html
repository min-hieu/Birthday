				Hi! Happy Birthday!!</span><br>
		</div>
		<span class="text"> I hope that you're doing awesome in class as always despite
			the fact that you keep being modest and saying that you're "stupid".</span><br>
		<span class="text"> Sorry in advance if this wall of text is incoherent 
			and just a complete mess lol. When I started studying abroad, I didn't expect
			to find anyone that I would fall in love with, not to mention if that person
			would even reciprocate the feeling. But so many things changed in such a 
			short amount of time. Till this moment, I still can't believe that I would 
			have someone to hug at night, someone to look forward to after studying,
			someone who I can pour my creativity and love into. A few days before the 
			confession, I was depressed, thinking of how could anyone like a monkey
			with no banana going on with his life. But I was wrong. You were kind and sweet.
			The kind of feeling I have around you is that which doesn't care about
			status, money, or look. It's the feeling of comfort and affection you have 
			with your family.</span><br>
		<span class="text"> 
			Now that you're 21... oh nose... things are 
			about to change sooo fast that it will make your head spin, I hope 
			that you'll realize your ultimate goal and comepletely dominate all the plebs
			that block your way. And me, I might be busy with my own ambition and goal
			but I will for sure be there always cheer on you on the side. I am still
			quite young and naive. I might not understand what people feel like to be 
			in their 20s or even just be an adult (with a phone number). However, I
			would always try my best to support you. 
		</span>
		<span class="text"> 
			Lastly, before you fall asleep reading this (lol), I will leave you with 
			this awesome piano solo and an inspirational quote from the "Art of Seduction",
